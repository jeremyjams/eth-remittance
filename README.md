ETH Exchange contract

To get the funds to Bob, Alice will allow the funds to be transferred through Carol's exchange shop. Carol will collect the ether from Alice and give the local currency to Bob.

Since they each have only half of the puzzle, Bob & Carol need to meet in person so they can supply both passwords to the contract. This is a security measure. It may help to understand this use-case as similar to a 2-factor authentication.
